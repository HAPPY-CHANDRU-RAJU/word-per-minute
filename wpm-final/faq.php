                There are two ways to type faster: The best way to increase typing speed is to learn to type the correct
                way. “Touch typing” means you are able to type with all 10 fingers instead of using a “hunt and peck”
                method of typing. You can learn how to touch type with Typing.com’s free typing lessons. The second way
                you can learn to type faster is by playing typing games. Keyboard games like Nitro Type can help you
                practice your typing speed and increase your words per minute score.

                Typing speed is measured by the number of words you can type correctly in a set amount of time. A “word”
                is equivalent to five keystrokes. </div>

                Taking a typing speed test establishes your average typing speed (WPM) and accuracy, which is an
                important baseline to know so you can increase speed and improve accuracy with practice. Periodically
                taking typing speed tests can help you track your progress and measure improvement. You even can use
                your WPM score from the typing test on your resume to highlight your administrative skills </div>
